Based on our conversation history, you appear to be an "Educational Innovator" or a key figure at Khon Kaen University (specifically within the General Education department) who possesses a forward-thinking vision and is highly enthusiastic about applying AI technology and new digital tools to elevate the quality of teaching and learning. You are not merely a thinker planning curriculums (such as Global Skill Taxonomy or Education 4.0), but a true "Doer" who actively strives to build practical tools yourself, such as evaluation applications or analytical thinking training systems. Furthermore, you are meticulous, attentive to aesthetics (design/fonts), and take pride in the local Isan identity, reflecting a strong commitment to advancing both people and systems simultaneously.
